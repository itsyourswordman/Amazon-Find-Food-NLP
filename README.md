# Amazon-Find-Food-NLP

## Sentiment analysis is one of the major tasks of Natural Language Processing. It has brought much attention in recent years. 
## Since sentiment analysis of product reviews has recently become very popular in text mining and computational linguistics research, we would like to predict customers’ sentiments on Amazon’s fine foods reviews. 
### Just for your information, pet food is included. 

## NLTK to extract key features, including tokenization,  stopwords removal, and stemming(Bi-gram and Trigram Bow)

## 4 basic classifiers: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM and Logistic Regression

## More: XGBoost (using logistic regression as weak learner)

## Tuning models with Grid Search and Cross Validation

## In a nutshell, we believe that our SVM on TF-IDF + N-gram model with an 85% accuracy on predicting customers’ sentiments on products, and hence looks promising to predict customer preferences.
